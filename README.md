# STAG Escapades
Digital escape room for West K's 2021 mental health week! Let's hope this doesn't turn into too much spaghetti code ;)

**Tech Stack**: Svelte + Rollup for the Frontend, Express + ws for Backend.

# Development
Requires node & npm to be installed. Git is recommended though not required.

1. Clone/fork this repo locally.
2. Setup a `.env` in the root directory using `template.env` as a guide (make sure to remove all `#` comments before saving).
3. Run `npm install`.

To start development server, run `npm run dev`, and to make production build, run `npm run build`.
