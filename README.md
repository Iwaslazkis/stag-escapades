# STAG Escapades
Digital ~~escape room~~ Okay, its grown much beyond an escape room at this point. Really, its 20-30 minutes worth of gameplay made basically entirely from scratch: its a custom-built interactive experience for West K's 2021 mental health week! Let's hope this doesn't turn into too much spaghetti code by the end;)

**Tech Stack**: `Svelte` + `Rollup` for the Frontend, `express` + `ws` for Backend.

# Development
Requires `node` & `npm` to be installed. `Git` is recommended though not required.

1. Clone/fork this repo locally.
2. Setup a `.env` in the root directory using `template.env` as a guide (make sure to remove all `#` comments before saving).
3. Run `npm ci`.

To start development server, run `npm run dev`, and to make production build, run `npm run build`.

# Credits

Though all the **programming** was done by me, @Iwaslazkis (**Diogo Iwasaki**), I'm far from the only one responsible for this. **Mckay Hutchinson** wrote most of the humourous **script**. **Sasha Holowka**, **Spencer Bater**, **Mckay** and I (**Diogo**) wrote the **narrative** and did all the **game design** for this. **Spencer Bater** did most of the game design for the puzzles too. **[Kristopher Falinski](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8PQh7RNOHwXgespCKDeCBg)** made a custom **soundtrack**, and made some **SFX**. Last but certainly not least, **[Serafina Busceti](https://www.instagram.com/thedoodle_den)** did all the **artwork & sprites**.
