#ACT: intro

#Startled
Woah there pal, you startled me

#Happy
I was just on my way to go see my friend Puzzloonie

#Happy
I wanted to talk to him about how it's mental health week

#Happy
It's all about taking care of ourselves and others

#Happy
Anyway have you seen him, he looks like this

He likes to spend his time on tables in schools around sharp objects

#Devastated
He got popped! OH NO

#Hopeful
Well there must be something we can do to help him

#Encouraging
Here go through this door while I think of something we can do

#PUZZLE: door 2

#ACT: room 2

#Happy
After looking through the knowledge of the worlds once more I have a new plan

#Happy
I found a small balloon repair shop just over that way

#Worried
The only problem is that there's just a small... giant ravine in between us and the shop

#Happy
But not to worry! I can send you some pieces to build a bridge

#Encouraging
You will have to work together to build that bridge as fast as you can!

#ACTIVITY: PositiveSocial

Good work! Now let's head inside and repair Puzzloonie

Oh there's a sign on the door
