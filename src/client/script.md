#Startled
Woah there pal, you startled me!

#Happy
I was just on my way to go see my friend Puzzloonie

#Happy
I wanted to talk to him about how it's mental health week

#Happy
It's all about taking care of ourselves and others

#Happy
Anyway have you seen him, he looks like this

He likes to spend his time on tables in school classrooms

#Devastated
He got popped! OH NO

#Hopeful
Well there must be something we can do to help him

#Happy
And it appears that there seems to be one universal cure

Chicken noodle soup!

#Curious
I'm pretty sure I had seen some ingredients for it in your classroom

Puzzloonie!??!!?

#Concerned
Puzzloonie: Woah Cubert calm down. What's wrong buddy?

#Happy
Cubert: I thought you got popped.

#Reassuring
Puzzloonie: Oh that balloon? Silly Cubert! I look nothing like that balloon.

#Reassuring
Puzzloonie: Plus, real life balloons aren't alive. It's just some rubber with a face drawn on it!
