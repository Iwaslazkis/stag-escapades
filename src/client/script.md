Woah there pal, you startled me!

My name's Cubert the Riddle Cube, by the way. Nice to meet you!

#Happy
I was just on my way to go see my friend Puzzloonie

#Happy
I wanted to talk to them about how it's mental health week

#Happy
It's all about taking care of ourselves and others

#Happy
Anyway have you seen them, they usually like to spend their time on tables in school classrooms

#Happy
They look like this:

#Hopeful
Well there must be something we can do to help them

#Encouraging
Here, if you solve this puzzle it'll help me come up with an idea!

Alright, I have searched up to the very limits of human knowledge on the best way to help Puzzloonie

#Happy
And it appears that there seems to be one universal cure

#Happy
Chicken noodle soup!

#Curious
I'm pretty sure I had seen some ingredients for it in your classroom

#Happy
Find them, and make some chicken noodle soup for Puzzloonie!
